This utility plugin lets you add the content-visibility CSS property on group blocks.

== Description ==

This WordPress utility plugin lets you add the `content-visibility` CSS property on group blocks. That property allows the browser to delay an element's rendering, including layout and painting until needed.

According to Google, you can significantly speed up the initial page load by skipping rendering on large portions of off-screen content.

Use this on long pages below-the-fold sections.

== Screenshots ==

1. This screen shot description corresponds to screenshot-1.(png|jpg|jpeg|gif). Note that the screenshot is taken from
the /assets directory or the directory that contains the stable readme.txt (tags or trunk). Screenshots in the /assets
directory take precedence. For example, `/assets/screenshot-1.png` would win over `/tags/4.3/screenshot-1.png`
(or jpg, jpeg, gif).
